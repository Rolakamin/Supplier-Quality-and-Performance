# Supplier Quality and Performance

## Project Overview
Enterprise Manufacturers Ltd has been struggling to assess the quality of materials supplied by vendors and address the impact of defective materials on production processes. The absence of a centralized procurement system has made it challenging to evaluate supplier performance effectively.

To tackle these challenges, the program management team has prioritized centralizing and analyzing supplier quality data. A project has been initiated to leverage Power BI for this analysis. The goal is to identify problem areas and deliver actionable insights to improve supplier quality and minimize production downtime.

## Business Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

- To evaluate supplier performance by analyzing defect quantities and downtime across vendors and plant locations.
- To identify specific vendor-material combinations and vendor-plant relationships that contribute to poor performance.
- To uncover trends and patterns in supplier quality data to support data-driven decision-making.
- To provide recommendations for improving supplier quality and optimizing production processes.

## Business Problems and Questions
Enterprise Manufacturers Ltd is facing several challenges due to the lack of a centralized procurement system to monitor supplier quality and performance. These challenges include:

1. Inability to identify which vendors and plants are responsible for the greatest defect quantities.

2. Lack of insight into which vendors and plants are causing the most downtime.

3. Difficulty analyzing specific material-vendor combinations that consistently perform poorly.

4. Challenges in identifying underperforming vendor-plant combinations.

5. Limited ability to compare the performance of the same vendor-material combinations across different plants.

To address these challenges, the following key questions need to be answered:

- Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest defect quantity?
- Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest downtime?
- Is there a particular combination of material and vendor that performs poorly?
- Is there a particular combination of vendor and plant that performs poorly?
- How does the same vendor and material perform across different plants?
