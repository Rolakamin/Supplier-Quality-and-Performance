# Supplier Quality and Performance

## Project Overview
Enterprise Manufacturers Ltd has been struggling to assess the quality of materials supplied by vendors and address the impact of defective materials on production processes. The absence of a centralized procurement system has made it challenging to evaluate supplier performance effectively.

To tackle these challenges, the program management team has prioritized centralizing and analyzing supplier quality data. A project has been initiated to leverage Power BI for this analysis. The goal is to identify problem areas and deliver actionable insights to improve supplier quality and minimize production downtime.
